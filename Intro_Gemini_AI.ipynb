This is crucial for understanding Python sorting. The code includes separate functions and examples for both approaches.\n",
            "* **In-place sorting example:**  The example for `list.sort()` clearly shows that the original list is modified.  The function `sort_list_in_place` now *correctly* doesn't return anything because it modifies the list directly.  This was a common oversight in previous responses.\n",

            "\n",
            "*   **Drink Plenty of Water:**  This is the most important thing. Don't wait until you're thirsty. Aim for at least 8 glasses of water a day, and more if you're active or spending time outdoors. Carry a reusable water bottle with you.\n",
            "*   **Electrolyte Drinks:**  If you're sweating a lot (e.g., during exercise or strenuous activity), consider electrolyte-rich drinks like sports drinks (in moderation due to sugar content) or electrolyte tablets/powders mixed with water. These help replenish lost salts and minerals.  Coconut water is also a good natural source of electrolytes.\n",
            "*   **Avoid Sugary Drinks:** Limit or avoid sugary sodas, juices, and sweetened beverages. They can dehydrate you and offer little nutritional value.\n",
            "*   **Limit Alcohol and Caffeine:** These can also have a dehydrating effect. If you do consume them, be sure to drink extra water.\n",

            "**2. Sun Protection:**\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **Sunscreen:** Apply a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher liberally 15-30 minutes before sun exposure. Reapply every two hours, especially after swimming or sweating. Don't forget areas like your ears, neck, and the tops of your feet.\n",
            "*   **Protective Clothing:** Wear light-colored, loose-fitting clothing that covers as much skin as possible.  Long sleeves, long pants, and wide-brimmed hats can offer excellent protection.\n",
            "*   **Sunglasses:**  Protect your eyes from harmful UV rays with sunglasses that block 100% of UVA and UVB rays.\n",
            "*   **Seek Shade:**  Limit your time in direct sunlight, especially during the peak hours of 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Seek shade under trees, umbrellas, or awnings.\n",

            "**3. Beat the Heat:**\n",

            "*   **Wash Hands Frequently:** Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water before preparing and eating food.\n",
            "*   **Avoid Leaving Food Out:** Don't leave food sitting out at room temperature for more than two hours (or one hour if the temperature is above 90°F).\n",

            "*   **Heat Stroke:**  High body temperature (104°F or higher), confusion, disorientation, seizures, loss of consciousness. **Heat stroke is a medical emergency. Call 911 immediately.** While waiting for help, try to cool the person down by moving them to a cooler place, removing excess clothing, and applying cool water to their skin.\n",
